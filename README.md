## Description
This repository serves as a starting point for greenfield Next.js projects. It includes a basic structure with placeholder content to demonstrate typical methods, a test bed for Vitest, and a toolkit to develop custom features. The project is set up with TypeScript for better code maintainability and type safety.

## Technologies Used
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) - Blazing fast unit test runner powered by Vite

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/andymagill/blanktype-next.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Testing
Run all Vitest unit tests with: `npm run test` or `yarn test`

### Analysis
To analyze the generated bundles: `npm run analyze` or `yarn analyze`

### Building for Production
To build the production-ready optimized bundle: `npm run build` or `yarn build`
