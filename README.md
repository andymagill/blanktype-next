## Description
This repository serves as a starting point for greenfield Next.js projects. It includes a basic structure with placeholder content to demonstrate typical methods, a test bed for Vitest, and a toolkit to develop custom features. The project is set up with TypeScript for better code maintainability and type safety.

## Technologies Used
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) - Blazing fast unit test runner powered by Vite
